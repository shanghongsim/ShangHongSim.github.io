Iâ€™m a graduating Master's student at the DeCLaRE Lab, advised by Prof. Soujanya Poria. My research focuses on addressing core limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly hallucinations, as they increasingly serve as information consolidators ðŸ§ . I developed a novel metric to evaluate LLM groundedness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and proposed a preference dataset to align models for improved grounding ðŸŽ¯.

My prior work spans interdisciplinary applications, including leveraging Unity3D to bridge vision and language tasks ðŸ‘€ and utilizing bioinformatics to identify therapeutically significant gene sets ðŸ§¬. With experience in state-of-the-art NLP and cancer biology, I hope to contribute experimental and analytical expertise to the projects that I am part of. I am passionate about advancing cutting-edge research and translating complex findings into practical, impactful solutions that drive both technical and business innovation ðŸ’¡.
